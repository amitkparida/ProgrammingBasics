// Mutex: Mutual Exclusion

// RACE CONDITION:
// 0. Race condition is a situation where two or more threads/process happend to change a common data at the same time.
// 1. If there is a race condition then we have to protect it and the protected setion is  called critical section/region.

// MUTEX:
// 0. Mutex is used to avoid race condition.
// 1. We use lock() , unlock() on mutex to avoid race condition.


#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
using namespace std;

int myAmount = 0;
std::mutex m;

void addMoney() {
	m.lock();
	++myAmount;
	m.unlock();
}

int main() {
	std::thread t1(addMoney);
	std::thread t2(addMoney);

	t1.join();
	t2.join();

	cout << myAmount << endl;
	return 0;
