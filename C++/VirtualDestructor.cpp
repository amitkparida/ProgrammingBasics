// TOPIC: Virtual Destructor 

// NOTES:
// 1. If we delete child class object through a pointer of parent class then it is undefined behaviour, 
//    if parent class doesn't have virtual destructor.
// 2. If we fail to declare destructor as virtual in parent class then we endup having memory leak.
