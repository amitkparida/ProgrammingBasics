// TOPIC: Graph Data Structure

// NOTES:
// 1. A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices/nodes and edges/arcs. 
//    The edges are lines that connect any two vertices in the graph.
// 
// 2. Generally, a graph G is represented as G = (V, E), where
//    - V is set of vertices
//    - E is set of edges, 
//
// 3. An edge is represented as an ordered pair of vertices (u, v) where u is source vertex and v is destination vertex.

// REPRESENTATION OF A GRAPH:
// The following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph:
//  - Adjacency Matrix
//  - Adjacency List
