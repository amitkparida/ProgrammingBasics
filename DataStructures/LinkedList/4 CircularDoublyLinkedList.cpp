// TOPIC: Cicular Doubly Linked List

// NOTES:
// 1. This is combination of CLL and DLL.

// ADVANTAGE :
// 1. List can be traversed from both the directions i.e.from head to tail or from tail to head.
// 2. Jumping from head to tail or from tail to head is done in constant time O(1).
// 3. Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap.

// DISADVANTAGE :
// 1. It takes extra memory in each node to accommodate previous pointer.
// 2. Lots of pointers involved while implementing or doing operations on a list.
