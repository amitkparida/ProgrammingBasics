// TOPIC: Cicular Linked List

// NOTES:
// 1. Circular linked list is modified version of singly linked list.
// 2. In circular linked list last node point to first node.

// INSERTIONS:
// 1. Insertion in an empty list
// 2. Insertion at the beginning of the list
// 3. Insertion at the end of the list
// 4. Insertion in between the nodes

// ADVANTAGES:
// 1. CPU sheduling
// 2. Queue can be implemented using one pointer (last). Becuase next to last is always first
//    so we don't have to implement first pointer at all.
// 3. Applications where you don't want to reset once you reach to last node.
