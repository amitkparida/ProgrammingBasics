// TOPIC: std::deque In C++ !!   (Double Ended Queue)

//NOTES:
//0. std::deque is an indexed sequence container.
//1. It allows fast insertion at both beginning and end.
//2. Unlike vector elements of deque are not stored contiguous.
//3. it uses individual allocated fixed size array, with additional bookkeeping, meaning index based access to deque
//   must perform two pointer dereference, but in vector we get in one dereference.
//4. The storage of a deque is automatically expanded and contracted as needed.
//5. Expension of deque is cheaper than expension of vector.
//6. A deque holding just one element has to allocate its full internal array(e.g. 8 times the object size on
//   64 - bit libstdc++; 16 times the object size or 4096 bytes, whichever is larger, on 64 - bit libc++).

//TIME COMPLEXITY :
//Random access - constant O(1)
//Insertion or removal of elements at the end or beginning - constant O(1)
//Insertion or removal of elements - linear O(n)


// PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

void print(const std::deque<int>& dqu) { for (int num : dqu) cout << num << " "; cout << endl; }

int main() {
    std::deque<int> dqu = { 2, 3, 4 };
    dqu.push_front(1);
    dqu.push_back(5);
    print(dqu);

    std::deque<int> dqu1 = { 2, 3, 4 };
    dqu1.pop_front();
    dqu1.pop_back();
    print(dqu1);

    return 0;
